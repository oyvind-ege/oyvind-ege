- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @oyvind-ege. A former genocide investigator and IT developer now working as an agile changemaker.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in hardcore information theory, agile team- and leadership practices, coaching, and a ton more. I do Crossfit when not at work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement agility when everyone expects waterfall.
